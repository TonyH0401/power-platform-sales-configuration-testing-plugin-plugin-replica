# Introduction

A collection of plugins used for the **Sales Configuration** Solution - **Testing Plugin** Applications - Replica Version.

This collection of plugins is the **replica version** because I've changed and moved a lot of folders around the original version, this repo shall serve as the main repository for this project and the orginal version shall be the **legacy version**.

# Getting Started

Once cloned, download all the missing packages for the solution and build the solution.

Use the **Plugin Registration Tool** in **XrmToolBox** to register the plugin and the plugin step.

- **Custom Action** might not be registered or displayed in the **Plugin Registration Tool**, you need to make sure the **Custom Action** is **activated** and **reload everything** from Power Platform to XrmToolBox.
- It's the same problem with the **Dataverse REST Builder**, you need to make sure the **Custom Action** is **activated** and **reload everything** from Power Platform to XrmToolBox.
